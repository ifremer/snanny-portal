These are collected using a high integrity 50-port rotary valve and injected into titanium foil bags. The samples are then stored for post recovery analysis. AquaLAB normally operates either completely automatically in a time-series mode, sampling at a user pre-set interval or a master device within a system may control the sampling regime. AquaLAB incorporates the ESM-1 Plus controller/datalogger. The system is programmed using the Eco-Script programming language. Eco-Script has been designed to provide the user with maximum control and flexibility in implementing sampling regimes. Scripts can be readily designed to include extra flushing, sample preservation, rejection or even in-situ sampling processing. The integral ESM datalogger/system control allows AquaLAB to act as an ideal host for other external sensors.","uuidModel":"599529fd-fd78-4a21-9ebf-029a851a54c4","custom":{"classifier":[{"name":"model","URI":"AquaLab","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"manufacturer","URI":"EnviroTech Instruments LLC","Ref":"modelData","definition":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/index.php?tema=52","codespace":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/xml.php?skosTema=40"},{"name":"Sample volume","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Samples per deployment","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Max. operating depth","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Dimensions","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Weight","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Materials","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"}],"contactMetaData":[{"role":"pointOfContact","email":"imbernardo@fc.ul.pt"}]}}
