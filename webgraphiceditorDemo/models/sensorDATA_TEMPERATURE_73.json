This compact, extremely rugged, high accuracy device is ideal for coastal and deep water oceanography, freshwater, groundwater, and ice research. The Model TR-1060 is calibrated to an accuracy of ±0.002 °C (ITS-90 and NIST traceable standards). Drift has been measured at better than 0.002 °C/year. The thermistors used in the TR-1060 are available in two housings. The standard thermistor has a time constant of less than 3 seconds. The optional fast thermistor has a time constant of about 0.1 seconds. The TR-1060 can be deployed for a period of up to three years by using one high-power 3 V lithium cell battery (CR123A). A new mechanical design mitigates condensation or risk of damage during battery replacement or data download. 8 MB of storage provides sufficient memory for 2,400,000 samples and a full set of samples can be taken by one battery. Flash memory ensures data retention for 20 years.","uuidModel":"0e237e18-a13b-3d80-8746-cf5168aaf043","custom":{"classifier":[{"name":"model","URI":"TR-1060","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"manufacturer","URI":"RBR Europe Ltd.","Ref":"modelData","definition":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/index.php?tema=52","codespace":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/xml.php?skosTema=40"},{"name":"Range","URI":"-5 to 35 ºC (extendable)","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Accuracy","URI":"± 0.002 ºC","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Resolution","URI":"< 0.00005 ºC","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Response time","URI":"3 s","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Depth rating","URI":"1200 m","Ref":"modelData","definition":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/index.php?tema=158"},{"name":"Supply voltage","URI":"3 VDC","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Communications","URI":"RS232","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Memory","URI":"8 Mbyte Flash (2,400,000 samples)","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Dimensions","URI":"Ø25 mm x 240 mm","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Weight in air","URI":"0.15 kg","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Weight in water","URI":"0.055 kg","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Materials","URI":"-","Ref":"modelData"}],"contactMetaData":[{"role":"pointOfContact","email":"Administration","name":""}]}}
