Water sampling is carried out by 5 Niskin - sample bottles each at a volume of 5 litres. They are horizontally attached to the revolvable middle axis and adjustable between 10 and 120 cm above the bottom. The axis of the Bottom Water Sampler is revolvably fixed to the outer rack and aligned with the current by a current vane before the touch-down on the sea floor. The outer rack itself is equipped with two current vanes for turning the whole instrument in the current’s flow.","uuidModel":"7c76c68c-1d97-36f2-98a5-4be142733962","custom":{"classifier":[{"name":"model","URI":"Bottom Water Sampler K/MT 420","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"manufacturer","URI":"K.U.M.
