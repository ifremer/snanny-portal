During the collection of data the pre-processing validated already the values and passes quality-evaluated data records on according to ISO to back-end systems. The internal data logging stores up to 5 years continuously highly solvent data on a CompactFlash card. Over telemetry (Rs-232/485, GSM/GPRS/UMTS, WLAN, Ethernet, Bluetooth, IRIDIUM, radio etc.) data are transmitted automatically on-line or at given times. With the SmartDI™ UW-Logger different sensors and measuring systems, e.g. CTD probes or Meteorology’s can be operated. With the remote-controlled quick look function as well as extensive configuration and diagnostic menus a user-friendly man-machine interface is realized. The modular structure makes a simple and economical adjustment possible to the most diverse applications, which is extensively expandable.","uuidModel":"ad1a141e-4c1c-4b7a-b0f1-e925071c7249","custom":{"classifier":[{"name":"model","URI":"SmartDI™","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"manufacturer","URI":"CONTROS Systems & Solutions GmbH","Ref":"modelData","definition":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/index.php?tema=52","codespace":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/xml.php?skosTema=40"},{"name":"Depth rating","URI":"-","Ref":"modelData","definition":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/index.php?tema=158"},{"name":"Housing material","URI":"-","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Weight","URI":"-","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Size","URI":"-","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Data storage capacity","URI":"-","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Time base stability","URI":"-","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Power supply","URI":"-","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Power consumption","URI":"-","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Temperature range","URI":"-","Ref":"modelData"}],"contactMetaData":[{"role":"pointOfContact","email":"imbernardo@fc.ul.pt"}]}}
