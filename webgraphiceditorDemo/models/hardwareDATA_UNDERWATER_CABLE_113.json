Alternatives to fossil fuels are a necessity. Wind farms are one of many responses to this question. Growing environmental awareness and high wind yields at sea point especially to offshore wind farms as trend-setting power producers. NSW, with its many years of experience in submarine and offshore cables, offers the necessary expertise to satisfy the challenging requirements of cabling wind farms. In addition, our manufacturing, which we do only in Nordenham, provides another benefit: short delivery times for the entire North Sea area from our own pier on the Weser. We stand ready to implement needed new developments with our customers and exploit the situation that research, project planning, manufacturing and consulting are available at a single location.","uuidModel":"62f1a0a4-5385-4a05-9f36-317eb56e1598","custom":{"classifier":[{"name":"model","URI":"Submarine Power Cables","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"manufacturer","URI":"NSW - Norddeutsche Seekabelwerke GmbH","Ref":"modelData","definition":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/index.php?tema=52","codespace":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/xml.php?skosTema=40"},{"name":"Type","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Core","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Cable diameter","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Bending radius","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Colour","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Depth rating","URI":"","Ref":"modelData","definition":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/index.php?tema=158"},{"name":"Weight in air","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Weight in water","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Breaking strenght","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Conductor resistance","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Insulation resistance","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Operating voltage","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Capacitance","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Bandwidth","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Impedance","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Attenuation","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Temperature","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Filler","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Shield","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Outer jacket","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"}],"contactMetaData":[{"role":"pointOfContact","email":"imbernardo@fc.ul.pt"}]}}
