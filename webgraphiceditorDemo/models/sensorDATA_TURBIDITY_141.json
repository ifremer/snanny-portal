The standard range is 10,000 NTU, but other optional ranges are available. The ANALITE 190 series turbidity probes are designed for monitoring and process applications where turbidity levels of up to 1,000 NTU may be encountered. Standard ranges are 100 NTU and 400 NTU, but other optional ranges are available. Specifically the ANALITE 180 and 190 probes are designed for applications that will not allow bio-fouling to build up such as short monitoring deployment or placement in fast and cold running water. The ANALITE 195 however, with its integral wiper assembly, is designed where bio-fouling or sedimentation buildup is likely. The ANALITE 180, 190 and 195 probes may be submerged to a depth rating of 30 meters (approx. 100 feet). This pressure rating applies to static (non-flowing) water. The ANALITE 190 and 195 probes uses 90° optics and employs infrared light in accordance with ISO7027. All probes use a unique modulation technique that ensures almost total rejection of ambient light conditions.","uuidModel":"38f68136-f725-3350-a502-7f9c8307a1e4","custom":{"classifier":[{"name":"model","URI":"NEP180 Series","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"manufacturer","URI":"McVan Instruments Pty Ltd.","Ref":"modelData","definition":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/index.php?tema=52","codespace":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/xml.php?skosTema=40"},{"name":"Turbidity range","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Resolution","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Accuracy","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Linearity","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Light source wavelength","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Depth rating","URI":"","Ref":"modelData","definition":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/index.php?tema=158"},{"name":"Power supply","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Max. power consumption","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Internal memory","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Communications","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Dimensions","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Weight in air","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Weight in water","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Materials","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"}],"contactMetaData":[{"role":"pointOfContact","email":"imbernardo@fc.ul.pt","name":"Ivo Bernardo"}]}}
