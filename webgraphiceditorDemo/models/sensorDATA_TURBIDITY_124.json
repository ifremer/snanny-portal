The integral wiper assembly provides long term reliable operation at remote sites where bio-fouling or sedimentation is likely. \r\n\r\nThe TS1000 is a low power unit and provides both 4-20 mA and 0-2.5 V outputs. The wiper is triggered by a separate control wire. The sensor is ideal for use in all water monitoring applications, including tidal and estuary monitoring. A durable acetal body, double O ring design ensures suitability for hash environment applications. It can be supplied in various ranges, and is fitted with a moulded polyurethane cable as standard. Other cable options may be available. \r\n\r\nThe TS1000 sensor is easy to install and provides users with a rugged and reliable solution to long term monitoring.","uuidModel":"6686b6b0-c141-444e-8bf8-cf9b953b77a4","custom":{"classifier":[{"name":"model","URI":"TS1000","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"manufacturer","URI":"Tyco International Ltd.","Ref":"modelData","definition":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/index.php?tema=52","codespace":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/xml.php?skosTema=40"},{"name":"Turbidity range","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Resolution","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Accuracy","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Linearity","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Light source wavelength","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Depth rating","URI":"","Ref":"modelData","definition":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/index.php?tema=158"},{"name":"Power supply","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Max. power consumption","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Internal memory","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Communications","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Dimensions","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Weight in air","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Weight in water","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Materials","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"}],"contactMetaData":[{"role":"pointOfContact","email":"imbernardo@fc.ul.pt"}]}}
