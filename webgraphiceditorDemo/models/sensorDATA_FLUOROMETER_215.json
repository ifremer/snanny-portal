Flag ship of the HydroScat family, the first commercial multi-spectral backscattering sensor and the first to measure both backscattering and fluorescence.  The HydroScat-6 has a long record of superior performance and reliability.  \r\n\r\nThe newly upgraded HydroScat-6P now includes an integrated deployment cage that provides compact but rugged protection and easy handling.  The stainless steel rods protect the housing and act as handles; the instrument face is recessed to protect windows when face-down on deck, there are no metal protrusions and the lowering eye is built into the end cap.  The HydroScat-6P also has a redesigned pressure case for improved maintainability.  It seals without threads exposed to water, eliminating the possibility of corrosion and seizing.","uuidModel":"5fe8454b-5574-4f3d-ac7f-03bae39cf1b6","custom":{"classifier":[{"name":"model","URI":"HydroScat-6P","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"manufacturer","URI":"HOBI Labs, Inc.","Ref":"modelData","definition":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/index.php?tema=52","codespace":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/xml.php?skosTema=40"},{"name":"Depth rating","URI":"330 m standard, 500 m optional","Ref":"modelData","definition":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/index.php?tema=158"},{"name":"Max. pressure","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Housing material","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Power supply","URI":"Internal rechargeable batteries provide up to 20 hrs continuous operation (longer in burst mode); power supply voltage 12V nom, 10V min, 15V max.","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Power consumption","URI":"3W max","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Weight","URI":"18.4 kg dry, 5 kg submerged.","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Size","URI":"Cylinder diameter: 20.3 cm (8\\\")\r\nCage length: 37.1 cm (14.6\\\") (allow 8 cm for mating connectors)\r\nCage ends: acetal hexagon 24.1 cm (9.5\\\") across flats.","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Excitation wavelength","URI":"700 nm excited by 442 nm (chlorophyll), 510 nm excited by 420 nm.","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Detector","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Range","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Detection limits","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Interface","URI":"HydroSoft software, included.","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Connector","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Operating temperature","URI":"0 to 35 C","Ref":"modelData"}],"contactMetaData":[{"role":"pointOfContact","email":"alimonti@hobilabs.com"}]}}
