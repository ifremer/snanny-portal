These parameters can include: \r\n\r\n• Torsional stability \r\n• Abrasion resistance \r\n• Buoyancy \r\n• Mechanical performance \r\n• Interstitial waterblocking \r\n• Depth rating \r\n\r\nThis knowledge has been gained through 25 years of experience in specifying and supplying cable for a diverse range of underwater applications. These applications have typically involved the termination of connectors to the cables which has provided invaluable additional input to the cable design process.\r\n\r\nPDM is therefore ideally positioned to provide a cable specification and supply service for underwater cables.\r\n\r\nIn addition and of significant benefit to Customers, PDM has an extensive stock of a wide range of cable that are available for immediate delivery. The option of PDM stock cable also gives Customers a cost benefit as cable supply is typically burdened with minimum order quantities that can have a dramatic affect on cable cost. Long lead times can also be a problem with special cables.\r\n\r\nThe majority of stock cables are polyurethane jacketed which means that subsequent termination and moulding processes are simplified. PDM also supplies a range of polyurethane elastomers and associated products for encapsulation and moulding and can offer material selection advice.","uuidModel":"fd5d3311-eeb1-4c9a-9833-2c4cc540022f","custom":{"classifier":[{"name":"model","URI":"Underwater Cables","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"manufacturer","URI":"PDM Neptec","Ref":"modelData","definition":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/index.php?tema=52","codespace":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/xml.php?skosTema=40"},{"name":"Type","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Core","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Cable diameter","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Bending radius","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Colour","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Depth rating","URI":"","Ref":"modelData","definition":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/index.php?tema=158"},{"name":"Weight in air","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Weight in water","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Breaking strenght","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Conductor resistance","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Insulation resistance","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Operating voltage","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Capacitance","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Bandwidth","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Impedance","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Attenuation","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Temperature","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Filler","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Shield","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Outer jacket","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"}],"contactMetaData":[{"role":"pointOfContact","email":"imbernardo@fc.ul.pt"}]}}
