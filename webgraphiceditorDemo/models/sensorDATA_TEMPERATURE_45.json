The sensor is based on a thermistorbridge. A Digital Signal Processor controls the sampling of the bridge and calculates the calibrated temperature in engineering units. The sensor is housed in a rugged titanium cylinder. The processed data is available as either RS232 or Aanderaa SR10 output. The user may configure the measurement range on the SR10 output; best accuracy is achieved with a short measurement range. The sensor can be mounted directly on the top end plate of the Aanderaa RCM 9 or RCM 11 and connected to the Main Control Board (Electronic Board) with a short cable, Sensor Cable 3854. The sensor can also be connected to the top end plate via a cable/string for temperature measurements in a different site than the instrument.","uuidModel":"c1d766bc-9b3d-368c-a510-13dd5998765a","custom":{"classifier":[{"name":"model","URI":"Temperature Sensor 4050","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"manufacturer","URI":"Aanderaa Data Instruments Inc.","Ref":"modelData","definition":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/index.php?tema=52","codespace":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/xml.php?skosTema=40"},{"name":"Range","URI":"-4 to 36 ºC","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Accuracy","URI":"±0.03 ºC","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Resolution","URI":"0.001 ºC","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Response time","URI":"<2 s","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Depth rating","URI":"6000 m","Ref":"modelData","definition":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/index.php?tema=158"},{"name":"Supply voltage","URI":"6 - 14 VDC","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Communications","URI":"RS232","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Memory","URI":"-","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Dimensions","URI":"Ø36 mm x 76 mm","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Weight in air","URI":"0.12 kg","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Weight in water","URI":"-","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Materials","URI":"Titanium and Epoxy coating","Ref":"modelData"}],"contactMetaData":[{"role":"pointOfContact","email":"Administration","name":""}]}}
