Featuring a 16.2 million pixel sensor, a Nikon F mount lens, high pressure optical glass view port and various housing options, the DSC 16,000 offers exceptional image quality for ROV, towed and autonomous applications.\r\nBy utilizing a completely unmodified Nikon D7000 digital camera, the DSC 16,000 is able to utilize high quality Nikon 35mm lenses, while allowing for relatively inexpensive and easy swap out of the camera body and/or lens.\r\nA custom control PC board provides autonomous intervalometer functions, remote control capability and high efficiency power management, required for long term deployments.\r\n\r\nThe mechanical packaging and electrical design of the DSC 16,000 have been done with an eye towards upgrading the camera body as newer and higher performing cameras become available. The camera is offered with four housing options (17-4 Stainless Steel, 316 Stainless Steel, 6AL-4V Titanium and Anodized 6061-T6 Aluminum).\r\n\r\nThe DSC 16,000 can be paired with the model 3831 strobe to create a completely autonomous, self powered camera system.","uuidModel":"4e6b6cf4-a9a3-4c79-8617-78d6995eecdb","custom":{"classifier":[{"name":"model","URI":"DSC 16,000 Digital Still Camera","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"manufacturer","URI":"Ocean Imaging Systems","Ref":"modelData","definition":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/index.php?tema=52","codespace":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/xml.php?skosTema=40"},{"name":"Horizontal resolution","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Light sensitivity","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Sensor type","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Signal to noise","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Scanning","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Power input","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Video output","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Standard lens","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Iris control","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Focus control","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Angle of view","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Depth","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Temperature","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Connector","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Dimensions","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Weight in air","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Weight in water","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Materials","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"}],"contactMetaData":[{"role":"pointOfContact","email":"imbernardo@fc.ul.pt"}]}}
