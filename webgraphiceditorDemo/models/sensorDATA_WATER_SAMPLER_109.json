It is capable of automatically collecting up to 20 samples per deployment (one litre volume) by a variety of different collection mechanisms.  Windows based software allows the user to set HydroCamel collection criteria, such as sample size, collection start time, time between sampling and flushing time, all sampling data is then recorded for later download. \r\n\r\nIn addition, the HydroCamel may be controlled by external instruments to ensure synchronised data and water collection. Equally, water quality instruments can be controlled and logged by the HydroCamel and water samples collected when certain parameters are exceeded.  The HydroCamel is extremely robust and utilises water sample bags which are impervious to both light and oxygen to maintain the best sample quality.","uuidModel":"92f7746a-35cf-3cf4-9ae4-ae8c98ee1fb5","custom":{"classifier":[{"name":"model","URI":"Hydrocamel","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"manufacturer","URI":"OSIL","Ref":"modelData","definition":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/index.php?tema=52","codespace":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/xml.php?skosTema=40"},{"name":"Sample volume","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Samples per deployment","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Max. operating depth","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Dimensions","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Weight","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Materials","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"}],"contactMetaData":[{"role":"pointOfContact","email":"imbernardo@fc.ul.pt","name":"Ivo Bernardo"}]}}
