In this time, several thousand housings of various sizes, shapes and depth ratings have been delivered to a wide range of customers.\r\nOur design team have many years of experience and are equipped with up to date 3D CAD and FEA software. Safety factors are built into all of our designs and we’ve never had a housing fail.\r\nWe have delivered housings in a wide range of materials including hard-anodised aluminium, titanium, stainless steel, nylon and UHMWPE. All housings are supplied with O-rings and fasteners as appropriate.\r\nWe can also build subsea housings that include underwater bulkhead connectors, mating connectors, connector assemblies, power-supplies, internal brackets etc. All housings are shallow soaktested and can, if required, be pressure tested to depths as deep as 12000 m.","uuidModel":"be4fd05d-7adc-349c-b42c-1a43232b4aba","custom":{"classifier":[{"name":"model","URI":"Subsea Pressure Housings","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"manufacturer","URI":"OceanTools Ltd.","Ref":"modelData","definition":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/index.php?tema=52","codespace":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/xml.php?skosTema=40"},{"name":"Max. operating depth","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Inner diameter ID","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Inner lenght IL","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Outer diameter OD","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Outer lenght OL","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Weight in air","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Weight in water","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Material","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"}],"contactMetaData":[{"role":"pointOfContact","email":"imbernardo@fc.ul.pt","name":"Ivo Bernardo"}]}}
