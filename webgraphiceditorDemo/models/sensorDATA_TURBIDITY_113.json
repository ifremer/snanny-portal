The sensor operates in sea water, lakes or swimming pools, as well as in more inhospitable locations such as rivers, industrial process plants, settling tanks or sewage treatment works. A special beam and reflector construction allows the user to modify the instrument to the particular environment. It may be used for either profiling or monitoring. Maximum beam-length 1/2 meter. The sensing element (the receiver) which is unaffected by ambient light or 50 Hz powered light, consists of a photo diode connected to a temperature compensated auto-range output amplifier. The light source (the transmitter) is equipped with a special control to ensure constant output independent of age effects and temperature influence.","uuidModel":"4daae8be-72e9-41f9-8800-75b5ac1c1324","custom":{"classifier":[{"name":"model","URI":"AQTU-660NM","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"manufacturer","URI":"Aquamatic","Ref":"modelData","definition":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/index.php?tema=52","codespace":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/xml.php?skosTema=40"},{"name":"Turbidity range","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Resolution","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Accuracy","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Linearity","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Light source wavelength","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Depth rating","URI":"","Ref":"modelData","definition":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/index.php?tema=158"},{"name":"Power supply","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Max. power consumption","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Internal memory","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Communications","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Dimensions","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Weight in air","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Weight in water","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Materials","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"}],"contactMetaData":[{"role":"pointOfContact","email":"imbernardo@fc.ul.pt"}]}}
