The Carousel has no moving-shaft seals that can bind up at low temperatures or under pressure because each bottle position has its own magnetically-activated lanyard release latch. Only the magnetic field - not a moving part - links the Carousel's lanyard release mechanism with the pylon control electronics. Sea-Bird's Carousel has been extensively deployed throughout the world's oceans, where it has built a reputation for reliability and ease of use. The Carousel has rapidly become the standard for oceanographic water sampling. The heart of every Carousel is the magnetically-actuated lanyard release. A pressure-proof electromagnet at each bottle position is energized on command to release the latch holding the bottle lanyard. Titanium, acetal plastic, and other corrosion-resistant materials are used in the latch and magnet assembly. The latch array’s modular construction makes servicing easy.","uuidModel":"210a8f81-ee96-4176-a400-961f631dbba0","custom":{"classifier":[{"name":"model","URI":"SBE 32 Carousel Water Sampler","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"manufacturer","URI":"Sea-Bird Electronics, Inc.","Ref":"modelData","definition":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/index.php?tema=52","codespace":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/xml.php?skosTema=40"},{"name":"Sample volume","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Samples per deployment","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Max. operating depth","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Dimensions","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Weight","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Materials","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"}],"contactMetaData":[{"role":"pointOfContact","email":"imbernardo@fc.ul.pt"}]}}
