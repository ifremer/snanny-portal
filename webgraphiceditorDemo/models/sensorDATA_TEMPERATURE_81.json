The SBE 38 is unaffected by shock and vibration, has high accuracy and stability, and is easy to use. It has a rugged, corrosion-proof, 10,500 meter (34,400 foot) titanium pressure housing. Real-time temperature data is transmitted in ASCII characters (°C or raw counts) via an RS-232 or optional RS-485 serial interface for display or logging by PC or data logger. The SBE 38’s measurement range is -5 to +35 °C; absolute accuracy is better than 0.001 °C (1 mK) and resolution is approximately 0.00025 °C (0.25 mK). Each sensor includes certification that demonstrates drift of less than 0.001 °C (1 mK) during a six-month period. Applications include calibration baths, oceanographic/aquatic research, and environmental monitoring. The SBE 38 is frequently integrated as a remote temperature sensor with an SBE 21 Thermosalinograph or SBE 45 MicroTSG, to provide accurate sea surface temperature. It can also be integrated as a secondary temperature sensor with an SBE 16plus, 16plus-IM, 16plus V2, 16plus-IM V2, or 19plus V2 SEACAT CTD.","uuidModel":"67b74f8d-74cb-4bf2-afdf-dcaf754c3a6a","custom":{"classifier":[{"name":"model","URI":"SBE 38","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"manufacturer","URI":"Sea-Bird Electronics, Inc.","Ref":"modelData","definition":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/index.php?tema=52","codespace":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/xml.php?skosTema=40"},{"name":"Range","URI":"-5 to 35 ºC","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Accuracy","URI":"± 0.001 ºC","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Resolution","URI":"0.00025 ºC","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Response time","URI":"0.5 s","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Depth rating","URI":"10500 m","Ref":"modelData","definition":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/index.php?tema=158"},{"name":"Supply voltage","URI":"8 - 15 VDC","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Communications","URI":"RS232 or RS485","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Memory","URI":"-","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Dimensions","URI":"Ø39 mm x 256 mm","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Weight in air","URI":"0.9 kg","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Weight in water","URI":"0.5 kg","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Materials","URI":"Titanium","Ref":"modelData"}],"contactMetaData":[{"role":"pointOfContact","email":"Administration"}]}}
