The PULSE 10 has a large detection envelope and is ideal for searching small to medium size areas. This detector works equally well in both fresh and salt water. It is in use by treasure hunters and salvage companies worldwide to locate a variety of targets including cannons, cannon balls, anchors, propellers, buried pipelines, lost airplanes, sunk cars, and shipwrecks. The Pulse 10 system consists of a Control Box, a Search Coil with 150 feet of cable, and a Tow Fish. The Search Coil mounts on the Fish and is towed through the water at 1-3 mph. An alarm sounds and the meter swings up when the Coil passes over a metal object. Power is supplied by two 12 volt batteries (not included). An altimeter can be attached to show the distance between the Fish and the bottom. The Coil can be removed from the Fish and held by a diver to pinpoint buried targets. With the Coil detached from the Fish, the system can also be used for land applications. The PULSE 10 is covered by a TWO YEAR WARRANTY.","uuidModel":"d3dd9f7f-0547-3f9a-8ee4-9e90e43799f8","custom":{"classifier":[{"name":"model","URI":"PULSE 10","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"manufacturer","URI":"JW Fishers Mfg.","Ref":"modelData","definition":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/index.php?tema=52","codespace":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/xml.php?skosTema=40"},{"name":"Operating range","URI":"-","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Sensitivity","URI":"-","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Resolution","URI":"-","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Absolute accuracy","URI":"-","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Gradient tolerance","URI":"-","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Heading error","URI":"-","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Sampling rate","URI":"-","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Depth rating","URI":"-","Ref":"modelData","definition":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/index.php?tema=158"},{"name":"Power requirement","URI":"12 VDC","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Communications","URI":"RS233 or Analog Output","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Operating temperature","URI":"-","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Diameter","URI":"-","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Weight in air","URI":"9 kg","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Weight in water","URI":"-","Ref":"modelData"}],"contactMetaData":[{"role":"pointOfContact","email":"Administration","name":""}]}}
