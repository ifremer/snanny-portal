Tilt measuring range is 360°, the data for the tilt are shown in degrees (°). Recorded data is stored in the logger‘s internal memory with a real-time clock reference for each measurement.\r\n\r\nThe DST tilt is supported by the SeaStar software and the Communication Box which serves as an interface between the logger and a PC.  Communication between the logger and the Communication Box is wireless.\r\n\r\nIn SeaStar, the user sets the start time, start date and sampling interval before starting the recorder. Up to seven different intervals can be set for the same measurement sequence. This is especially useful when more frequent measurements are needed at a certain time period.\r\n\r\nWith default programming depth, temperature, and tilt are recorded at the same time. Optionally, temperature-depth and tilt can be set as primary and secondary parameter pairs/parameters with different sampling frequency. That way memory partitioning can be customized according to individual preferences.\r\n\r\nWhen the DST has been recovered, recorded data is uploaded to SeaStar where results are displayed both in graphic and tabular form. After retrieving the data, the DST can be re-programmed and reused as long as the battery lasts.","uuidModel":"a622d371-3d69-4e3c-acb0-8ca7d6721061","custom":{"classifier":[{"name":"model","URI":"DST Tilt","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"manufacturer","URI":"Star-Oddi","Ref":"modelData","definition":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/index.php?tema=52","codespace":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/xml.php?skosTema=40"},{"name":"Type","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Angular range","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Scale factors","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Resolution","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Repeatability","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Linearity","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Temperature coefficient","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Time constant","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Tilt output","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Depth rating","URI":"","Ref":"modelData","definition":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/index.php?tema=158"},{"name":"Power","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Operating temperature","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Size","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Weight in air","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Material","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"}],"contactMetaData":[{"role":"pointOfContact","email":"imbernardo@fc.ul.pt"}]}}
